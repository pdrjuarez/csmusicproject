on the terminal, run

	scp -i ~/musicproject.pem setup.sh ec2-user@publicdns:~/

Then, ssh into the ec2 instance:

	ssh -i ~/musicproject.pem ec2-user@publicdns

setup.sh should be here. 
	
	chmod 700 setup.sh
	./setup.sh

Wait like 20 minutes for everything to install. There might be some prompts, answer them
Mount the music snapshot to the instance as /mnt/music
move validate.py to the server. For some reason it won't let us move it to root, so move it to /home/ec2-user:

	scp -i ~/musicproject.pem csvify.py ec2-user@publicdns:~/

on the ec2 instance, cd to make sure we're in the right spot, then move it to root:

	cd
	mv /home/ec2-user/csvify.py ~

To csvify all of the data, we'd type in

	python csvify.py '' <csv_filename.csv>

(Don't do this, itll probably crash because its so much)

You can tell it to only csvify a subdirectory though, like:
	
	python csvify.py A/A A_A.csv

This turns to one csv all the information in the files in data/A/A and ignores the rest.

To do: figure out how to mount extra volumes and store the information in it. Or how to directly export data into the S3 buckets.
