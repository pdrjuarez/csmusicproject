Things to think about

	I have succesfully created a bash script that will install everything we need on an ec2 instance to analyze the files, its in the git repo

	We can get this information for every h5 file (some h5 files have more than one song, but we can pick one song at a time for these)

	'get_analysis_sample_rate', 'get_artist_7digitalid', 'get_artist_familiarity', 'get_artist_hotttnesss', 'get_artist_id', 'get_artist_latitude', 'get_artist_location', 'get_artist_longitude', 'get_artist_mbid', 'get_artist_mbtags', 'get_artist_mbtags_count', 'get_artist_name', 'get_artist_playmeid', 'get_artist_terms', 'get_artist_terms_freq', 'get_artist_terms_weight', 'get_audio_md5', 'get_bars_confidence', 'get_bars_start', 'get_beats_confidence', 'get_beats_start', 'get_danceability', 'get_duration', 'get_end_of_fade_in', 'get_energy', 'get_key', 'get_key_confidence', 'get_loudness', 'get_mode', 'get_mode_confidence', 'get_num_songs', 'get_release', 'get_release_7digitalid', 'get_sections_confidence', 'get_sections_start', 'get_segments_confidence', 'get_segments_loudness_max', 'get_segments_loudness_max_time', 'get_segments_loudness_start', 'get_segments_pitches', 'get_segments_start', 'get_segments_timbre', 'get_similar_artists', 'get_song_hotttnesss', 'get_song_id', 'get_start_of_fade_out', 'get_tatums_confidence', 'get_tatums_start', 'get_tempo', 'get_time_signature', 'get_time_signature_confidence', 'get_title', 'get_track_7digitalid', 'get_track_id', 'get_year'

	Stuff I think is relevant:

	year
	title
	artist_familiarity
	artist_hotttnesss
	artist_latitude
	artist_longitude
	artist_location
	artist_name
	artist_terms (This is stuff like radio, dance, techno, country)
	artist_terms_freq (not sure what this is)
	artist_terms_weight (Not sure what this is but related to the above 2? I think one of these is how often this term is mentioned in relation to this artist or something. Both are arrays of numbers 0 to 1

	duration
	danceability
	energy

	mode
	key
	tempo
	loudness
	time_signature

	(For the above, we have confidence levels, maybe for analysis specific to these categories we can disregard the song when confidence<0.25 or something?)

	Every segment and section thing. 
	Segments are pretty big. For the songs I looked at, each one had at least 1000 segments, so this is potentially a lot of computation/analysis.
	Here's the information on segments for each song: http://developer.echonest.com/docs/v4/_static/AnalyzeDocumentation.pdf

Validation
	
	Do we want to convert all this to a bunch of csv files? It would be difficult to do this because a lot of the data is in arrays, could we turn an array [1,2,3,4] into like a single field '1/2/3/4/5'? 

	The alternative is to always do the analysis from scratch essentially. Annoying but possibly doable

	IF we want to convert to csv files, we want a form of validation to throw away useless songs or songs without much information
	Do we ignore all songs with certain fields missing, if so which ones, and which fields do we just never care about?
